Model_BT.xml is a model for BT/TT
Model_HV.xml is a model for Hor/Ver

We uploaded executable files with encoding configurations and batch files containing parameters to result in tables of submitted paper. Note that executable files (.exe files) have been compiled using VS 2019 on Windows 10. The base software is VTM 3.0 (official site to download is as follows. https://vcgit.hhi.fraunhofer.de/jvet/VVCSoftware_VTM/-/tree/VTM-3.0)
